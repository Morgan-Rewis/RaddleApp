# RaddleApp
A simple app used to launch the website raddle.me, so you don't need to have a tab open in your browser. It's basically just a shitty web browser that only lets you view this site, or any other that you can get to by links through it. Supports Material 3 theming on the home screen icon. If you hit the X or the back button twice while you're on the home screen it'll go completely white until you close/reopen it, so don't do that

This was just a personal project for me, I have no plans to update it in the future, nor to release it on Google Play
